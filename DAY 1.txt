DAY-1

NETWORK : is simply defined as something that connects things together for a specific purpose. ( to share information)

          EG: Computers, Mobile Phones ,Tablets,
		  
		  => a computer network connects two or more devices together to share a nearly limitless range of information and services
		  
		  EG : Documents
		       Email and IM ( Instant Messeging)
			   Websites
			   storing and accessing information from Databases
			   Streaming Music
			   Printers 
			   Telephony
			   Video conferencing
			   

Protocols : Are the rules or set of instructions to enable communication

EG : HTTP ( Hyper text transfer protocol)
     HTTPS ( Secure HTTP)
     FTP (file transfer protocol)
     TFTP	 (Trivial FTP)
	 SMTP ( Simple mail transfer protocol) 
	 

Reference Model : Its developed to allow products from different manufactures to interoperate on a network.
                      it act  as a  blueprint, detailing standards for how the device should work in a network enviornment 
					  and how communication should work.
					  
					  The current Reference model we use now is ISO-OSI reference model.
					  Before OSI model there was DoD model ( Department of Defense )
					  
NETWORK TYPES 

1. LAN ( LOCAL AREA NETWORK )
=> A network that spans in a small area
=> a high speed network
=> managed by an organization or a person

  eg: Network in office building
      Network in Campus
      Network in Home
      Network In Corporate offices
